Theory, overview, and process for designing experimental research

### Notes:
Familiar with the theory behind experimental design, though random assignment is something I am less familiar with
One concept to consider, especially when interpreting results, is external validity. Always consider that results in an overly “sterile” testing environment may not reflect what real life is like
Hypothesis design needs to be precise, meaningful, testable, and falsifiable (you must be able to disprove the statement with empirical data)

Lee, Thomer, and Lampe present a different topic of study, but the experimental approach is one that we will adopt for the capstone- read this with an eye toward the study design, methodology, consideration of variables, etc.

### Notes:
Christian’s Thoughts:
Focus here is analyzing the effect of different data labels (more dislikes than likes, negativity flags, quantity of shares etc.) on user perception of the data and how they will act after the fact
Each data label has different levels of justification (flagging you can say why its flagged while dislike is just a number of users who view the content negatively)
Variables are a binary, whether a label can be assigned or not determines if a variable is present
Variables assessed with perception of the data (deserved, appropriate, justified)
Participants asked to respond how they would respond to the data
Determines outcome of analysis based on whether hypotheses proposed were supported by the data

This paper covers the prior work that we will develop further in this capstone- this work tested using LLM’s to enhance metadata records for physical samples
With the capstone, we will be exploring what information researchers need to encounter in a UI in order to understand and trust this type of information. 

### Notes:
Focus here is on using three different LLMs to predict metadata labels for scientific records
LLMs may be useful as a domain agnostic classification method
Zero-Shot = Instructions only, Few-Shot = Instructions + Few Examples
Want to answer 4 main research questions: 
How do different record-to-text conversions affect performance? Metadata description and values perform best
Is it useful to have an LLM summarize the record text? 
Is top-down or bottom-up search better for incorporating the label hierarchy? 
How much can few-shot prompting improve over zero-shot prompting?
Tested multiple testing combinations, comparing to traditional classification ML models

### Notes:
Data management and preservation is key for sciences where sample collection is destructive or provides a one time opportunity for in-situ interpretations
What kind of contextual data (sampling method, recording systems, environmental setting, documentor profile) is important for users to have so they can understand potential biases from the original sample/data documenter, interpretations can change over time
Research shows that typically metadata is not enough for interpretation and documentation on provenance and acquisition is more helpful
