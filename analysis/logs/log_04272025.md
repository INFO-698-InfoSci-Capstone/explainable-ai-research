# Weekly/Bi-Weekly Log

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Date: 
Week number, today's date, etc. 

Sunday, April 27th. End of week eight (assuming week one is first contact with mentors).

### Meeting Summary:

This I met twice with Andrea and Natalie, the first meeting being a consultation meeting with Ann Shivers-McNair from the UA library and the second meeting being our weekly meeting. In the first meeting we discussed the project as a whole and potential next steps. The focus of the conversation was mostly on experimental design and Ann's experience working on trust calibration experiments. The weekly meeting we discussed the draft experimental qualtrics form, which contains the UIs and a series of questions for participants to answer. I got a lot of feedback and I have a lot of things to change, but I think by early next week I can have a solid second draft.

#### Action items:

Revising experiment design based on comments. Reframing Figma UIs to look more like SESAR than iSamples UI.
Work on poster.

### Number of hours: 
A quantity of hours, maybe towards specific tasks. 

~5 hours

### Rose:
The highlight from the previous weekly/bi-weekly working period, such as something you found particularly rewarding. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

Got a good first draft of the experiment done. Now I need to make some changes based on feedback.

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future. 

Excited to see how my revised survey will look.

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. 

Have to spend a decent amount of time in Figma reorganizing the structure.
