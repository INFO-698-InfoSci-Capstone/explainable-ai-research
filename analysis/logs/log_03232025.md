# Weekly/Bi-Weekly Log

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Date: 
Week number, today's date, etc. 

Sunday, March 23rd. End of week three (assuming week one is first contact with mentors).

### Meeting Summary:
Weekly meeting with Natalie Raia and Andrea Thomer occured on Thursday, March 20th at 9am. 

Notes from meeting: 

- Use Github as a file repository and for tracking progress; Christian manages the Github
- From Gergle & Tan
  - Hypothesis development: what relationship do we want to investigate?
  - What hypotheses are testable with the method we are intending to use?
- Larger goal: design a series of experiments around interface cues OR quality and nature of metadata in a record
  - Two factors of concern: (1) presenting a perfect interface that is outside of context (of real life); (2) company route may not have the respondents we need, may need to find route around
  - How do we design a baseline test to gauge peopleâ€™s trust in metadata?
  - Options for end goal of capstone: designing the UI, and/or what are the statistical tests you would need to run on these experiments after the fact to do this

#### Action items:
- Finish reading the remaining four papers (finish Song, read Faniel)
- Draft 10 hypotheses, evaluate according to four factors- precise, meaningful, testable, and falsifiable
  - Start to think about how you would test the hypotheses in the UI environment 
  - What quantitative ways to derive insights from survey results


### Number of hours: 
A quantity of hours, maybe towards specific tasks. 

Estimate ~3-4 hours reading papers (see data folder)

### Rose:
The highlight from the previous weekly/bi-weekly working period, such as something you found particularly rewarding. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

Further in-depth reading into the literature review.

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future. 

Developing and brain storming hypotheses for project

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. 

Focusing in on my reading and trying to read between the lines. These are heavy academic papers, so I am working through them slowly with a fine toothed comb.

## Additional thought
Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.
