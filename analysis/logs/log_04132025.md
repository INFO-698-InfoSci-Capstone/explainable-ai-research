### Date: 
Week number, today's date, etc. 

Sunday, April 13th. End of week six (assuming week one is first contact with mentors).

### Meeting Summary:
Was not able to meet this week, sent a summary email instead.


#### Action items:

Sharing experimental design document and getting feedback.

### Number of hours: 
A quantity of hours, maybe towards specific tasks. 

~4 hours on following Gergle et al. for experimental design.

### Rose:
The highlight from the previous weekly/bi-weekly working period, such as something you found particularly rewarding. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

I am excited to have the framework for the experiment completed so I can implement the experiment in Qualtrics.

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future. 

Building the UIs in Figma.

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. 

Determining respondant question distribution, which is a crucial part of experimental design.
