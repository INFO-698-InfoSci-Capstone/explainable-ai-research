# Weekly/Bi-Weekly Log

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Date: 
Week number, today's date, etc. 

Sunday, March 30th. End of week four (assuming week one is first contact with mentors).

### Meeting Summary:
Weekly meeting with Natalie Raia and Andrea Thomer occured on Thursday, March 27th at 10am. 

Prelim Questions from Christian:
Greg has given us a proposal to complete (mostly fill in the blank), we need to define what I will do directly there. 
Executive Summary
Literature Review
Project Deliverables
Timeline
Natalie and Andrea sign, Greg reviews/grades it
At this point it seems like it would make most sense to stick to the project description below, and my 10 hypotheses reflect that. 

Notes from meeting/summary:
Defined hypotheses to test the for the experiment and also reviewed hypothesis development in the context of HCI.
Defined control variable.



#### Action items:
- Fill out the proposal
- Define the deliverables


### Number of hours: 
A quantity of hours, maybe towards specific tasks. 

Estimate ~4-6 hours writing proposal and reviewing comments from Andrea and Natalie.

### Rose:
The highlight from the previous weekly/bi-weekly working period, such as something you found particularly rewarding. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

I was a bit concerned about the experiment implementation because my work was starting to feel very similar to a previous researcher's work on Andrea's team, but she encouraged me to build off their research and that was encouraging.

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future. 

Addressing comments from Andrea and Natalie for the proposal and finally wrapping my head around the concepts for the experimental process.

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. 

Learning figma from scratch, and researching tests for validating the experimental results.
