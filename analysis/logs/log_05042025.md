### Date: 
Week number, today's date, etc. 

Sunday, May 4th. End of week nine (assuming week one is first contact with mentors).

### Meeting Summary:

This past week we discussed the survey to finalize it for a preliminary launch to Dr. Raia's colleagues. We also looked at the poster draft.

#### Action items:

Poster, Survey, Methodology

### Number of hours: 

10 hours

### Rose:
The highlight from the previous weekly/bi-weekly working period, such as something you found particularly rewarding. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

To present the poster at the iShowcase and receive feedback on the survey.

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future. 

Happy that I was able to refine some of my Figma and Qualtrics skills for finalizing the survey, I had to make quite a few versions before it started to look right.

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. 

Not looking forward to writing the Methodologies as writing is not my strong suit.
