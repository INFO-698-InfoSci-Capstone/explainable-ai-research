# Weekly/Bi-Weekly Log

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Date: 
Week number, today's date, etc. 

Sunday, April 20th. End of week seven (assuming week one is first contact with mentors).

### Meeting Summary:

Reviewing experimental framework and Figma UIs, and discussing an updated internal calendar for my project.

#### Action items:

Create draft qualtrics form based on feedback with the experimental UIs for review by weekly meeting on April 24th.

Writing up methodology.


### Number of hours: 
A quantity of hours, maybe towards specific tasks. 

~4 hours on qualtrics, formatting Figma UIs, meeting with an external party for project consultation, and starting a formal methodology for publishing experimental design down the road.

### Rose:
The highlight from the previous weekly/bi-weekly working period, such as something you found particularly rewarding. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

Finally have a draft form for data collection and lots of potential pilot users!

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future. 

Refining the Qualtrics form based on Andrea and Natalie's Feedback.

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. 

Not looking forward to writing methodology as writing is not my strong suit.
